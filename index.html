      Hi, I'm Lindsey. <br/>

      When I'm not perusing the Internet to find something neat to incorporate into 
      a website or app, you can probably find me in class or at work. I'm a third year Web and Mobile Computing 
      major at Rochester Institute of Technology and I love designing and developing websites and apps. 
      What do I believe in? Creating beautiful, accessible websites and apps that are dynamic and
      fun to use. <br/> <br/>

      At the base of my soul, I am a curious person with high goals and big dreams. I love asking
      questions, taking things apart, and finding out how they work. I want to create a better 
      world for the next generations, and I want to find ways to make life better. <br/> <br/>
      
      Here's a little bit about me: I grew up in Rhode Island and am currently based out of Rochester, New York.
      I have a really cute <a class="white" href="assets/media/Reese.jpg" target="_blank">dog</a> and 
      I enjoy creating cool things from chainmaille to stained glass to crocheted things, and of course, 
      websites and apps.
